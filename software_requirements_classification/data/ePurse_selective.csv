The CEP card may support multiple currencies. Each currency occupies a ƒ??slotƒ? within the CEP. The slots are defined by the currency supported. The currency for an individual slot is determined during load or currency exchange. Currency exchange could apply to a single slot, and then only for the total balance;nonsec,,,
It is a card issuerƒ??s decision to determine the currencies that are allowed to occupy slots in the CEP card. This decision is made by the card issuer during the load or currency exchange transaction, by approving or rejecting the request to authorize the transaction;nonsec,,,
A single currency cannot occupy more than one slot. The CEP card must not permit a slot to be assigned a currency if another slot in the CEP card has already been assigned to that currency;nonsec,,,,
The CEP card limits each slot to a maximum balance. The maximum balance for a slot is established when a currency is assigned to the slot, and is determined externally by the card issuer or by CEP card data which indicates a maximum balance in a reference currency. There is no requirement that all slot maximums have the same relative value, and there is no requirement for the card to maintain a maximum total value;nonsec,,
Only one version of the CA public key is required in the card. This requires that the PSAMs with which the CEP card exchanges cryptograms must be capable of generating and validating cryptograms using the relevant keys from all current cards;sec,,,,
Two-way, or mutual, authentication, where the card authenticates the terminal and the terminal authenticates the card for each transaction, must be performed for off-line transactions;sec
For increased security and convenience, asymmetric cryptography must be used as the authentication security for off-line transactions;sec,,,

Funds issuers must accept funds authorization requests, regardless of the load currency type, as permitted;sec,,
Load devices that are available to the general public should support multiple sources of funding and support both linked and unlinked loads;nonsec,,,,
Authorizations for load transactions require a form of cardholder authentication for funds requests;sec,,,,
The load device must support on-line PIN encryption or off-line PIN verification;sec,,,,
The load device which supports only off-line PIN verification must support both the off-line PIN encryption method and the off-line PIN plain text verification method as defined in EMV;sec,,,,
Unload transactions do not require cardholder authentication. (However, an acquirerƒ??s devices may be configured such that authentication is required for access.);sec,,,
The architecture for the electronic purse should not preclude the eventual deployment of a variety of devices to meet the needs of many card acceptance environments. Unload must not be precluded from being supported on any or all of these devices at the option of the acquirer;nonsec,,,,

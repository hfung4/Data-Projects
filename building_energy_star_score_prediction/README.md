**Building Energy Star Score Prediction Project**



- The objective of this problem is to predict the the energy-star score of buildings.  This was a "take-home" data project.



- In this data project, I performed the following:
  - Data cleaning and processing (handle outliers and missing values).
  - Exploratory analysis.
  - Feature engineering and feature selection.
  - Split data into test/train set and establish a baseline prediction.
  - Model evaluation and selection: compare several models (with each other and wrt baseline) based on a performance metric. Use resampling methods such as k-fold CV to estimated the test error.
  - Select the "best" model and tune its hyperparameters.
  - Evaluate the final "optimized" model on the test set.
  - Interpret the results.

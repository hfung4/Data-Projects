My past research in control algorithms for bipedal locomotion.

- My thesis written in 2011 that documents my work in developing a novel control algorithm for a 13-DOF bipedal robot based on centroidal moment pivot (CMP) control.
- Journal publication on a disturbance compensation CMP controller for bipedal robots in 2015 .

My past research in control algorithms for bipedal locomotion.

(1) My thesis (written in 2011) that documents my development of a novel control algorithm for a 13-DOF bipedal robot based on centroidal moment pivot (CMP) control.
(2) Journal publication on a disturbance compensation CMP controller for bipedal robots in 2015 .

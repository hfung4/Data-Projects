**My past research in control algorithms for bipedal locomotion.**

This directory contains:
- My thesis (written in 2011) that documents my development of a novel control algorithm for a 13-DOF bipedal robot based on centroidal moment pivot (CMP) control.
- A journal publication on a disturbance compensation CMP controller for bipedal robots in 2015.

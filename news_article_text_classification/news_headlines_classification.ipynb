    "## Topic Modelling\n",
    "- Topic modeling is a method for unsupervised classification of documents, similar to clustering on numeric data, which finds some natural groups of items (topics) even when we’re not sure what we’re looking for.\n",
    "- It is similar to clustering for numerical data.\n",
    "- Topic modeling provides methods for automatically organizing, understanding, searching, and summarizing large electronic archives.\n",
    "    - Discovering the hidden themes in the collection.\n",
    "    - Classifying the documents into the discovered themes.\n",
    "    - Using the classification to organize/summarize/search the documents.\n",
    "    - For example, let’s say a document belongs to the topics food, dogs and health. So if a user queries “dog food”, they might find the above-mentioned document relevant because it covers those topics(among other topics).  Therefore, by annotating the document, based on the topics predicted by the modeling method, we are able to optimize our search process."

    "https://blog.echen.me/2011/08/22/introduction-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation/\n",
    "- One of the most popular topic modeling methods. \n",
    "-  Each document is made up of various words, and each topic also has various words belonging to it. \n",
    "-  The aim of LDA is to find topics a document belongs to, based on the words in it.\n",
    "- Assumptions:\n",
    "    - We know beforehand how many topics we want. ‘k’ is pre-decided.\n",
    "    - Each document is just a collection of words or a “bag of words”.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- Two parts in LDA:\n",
    "    - The words that belong to a document, that we already know.\n",
    "    - The words that belong to a topic or the probability of words belonging into a topic, that we need to calculate.\n",
    "- We use an algorithm to find the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- LDA represents documents as a mixture of topics. Similarly, a topic is a mixture of words. If a word has high probability of being in a topic, all the documents having w will be more strongly associated with t as well. \n",
    "- Similarly, if w is not very probable to be in t, the documents which contain the w will be having very low probability of being in t, because rest of the words in d will belong to some other topic and hence d will have a higher probability for those topic. \n",
    "- So even if w gets added to t, it won’t be bringing many such documents to t."

    "- Perhaps the best-known word vector model is word2vec, originally proposed in 2013. The general idea of word2vec is, for a given focus word, to use the context of the word — i.e., the other words immediately before and after it — to provide hints about what the focus word might mean. To do this, word2vec uses a sliding window technique, where it considers snippets of text only a few tokens long at a time."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "- In this data project, I performed the following:\n",
    "    - Processed headline text data: tokenize, lemmatize, removed non-alphanumeric characters and stopwords, find bigrams and trigrams\n",
    "    - Explored the headline text data.\n",
    "    - Performed topic modelling with LDA\n",
    "    - Developed a word embedding model and a t-SNE representation of the word embeddings\n",
    "    - Performed modelling using textcat (CNN) in spaCY\n",
    "    - Get the tf-idf representation of the headlines and performed dimension reduction.\n",
    "    - Compared the performance of the following statistical learning methods:\n",
    "        - SVD, Random Forest, Adaboost, KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "    - Optimized the models through hyperparameters tuning for SVD and Random Forest\n",
    "    - Selected the \"best\" model based on highest f1-score (on test data)\n",
    "    - Plotted the ROC of SVD and computed the confusion matrix.\n",
    "    - Out of all the models, the optimized SVD model has the highest f1-score (on test dataset): about 0.81."

    "## Final Thoughts\n",
    "- The optimized SVD model outperformed the textcat CNN model (both models uses the transformed headline text data as inputs).\n",
    "- The SVD used tf-idf representations of the headlines as features.\n",
    "- In the future, I will try to use CNN with word-embeddings to represent the documents. Possibly, I will use word2vec since my headline dataset is too small to train the word embedding model. This is an example of \"transfer learning\" since I use word-embeddings trained from a very large dataset (Google News) to compensate the limitation of my small headline dataset)."

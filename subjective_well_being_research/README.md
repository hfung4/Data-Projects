# Subjective Wellbeing Research

- This is a project that I completed during the Summer of 2017 for Prof. Chris Barrington-Leigh at the Institute for Health and Social Policy, McGill University. 
- Chris is an important mentor to me and one of my aspirational figures.  His website is:

- The research project involved developing an interactive web application (in PHP) to survey respondents on Amazon Mturk using anchoring vignettes.
-  Anchoring vignettes is a type of survey approach, it has two steps: 
  1. Ask respondents a set of self-assessment questions that are related to his/her subjective wellbeing.
  2. Ask respondents to assess vignettes that describe the life situation of a hypothetical person. The respondents are then asked to assess the life satisfaction of the hypothetical person using the same response scale as the self assessment questions.

- The web application survey is part of a larger project that investigates the effect of relative standings in non-monetary life domains such as social relationships and physical health on life satisfaction.
